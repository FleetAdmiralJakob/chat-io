# User Preferences

- **ALWAYS** format everything before saying a task is completed. Run `pnpm format:write` (or equivalent) as the final step before committing.
- **ALWAYS** make a new branch for new changes from `main` (trunk-based development) BEFORE committing anything.
- **DO NOT** commit unless told otherwise or approved to do so. Let me review the changes first locally before committing myself.
- **DO NOT** commit directly to `main` if not directly told or approved to do so.
- **ALWAYS** update `.env.example` when updating environment variables.
